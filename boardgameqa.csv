"A few players are playing a boardgame. The current state of the game is as follows. The baboon has a card that is green in color, and invented a time machine. The bat becomes an enemy of the swordfish. The black bear holds the same number of points as the moose but does not raise a peace flag for the penguin. The cow knows the defensive plans of the oscar. The doctorfish learns the basics of resource management from the goldfish. The dog prepares armor for the eagle. The halibut needs support from the elephant. The hare has a green tea. The hare has four friends that are mean and 2 friends that are not. The koala burns the warehouse of the kudu, and winks at the ferret. The leopard respects the parrot. The mosquito attacks the green fields whose owner is the crocodile. The phoenix winks at the aardvark. The polar bear learns the basics of resource management from the sun bear. The canary does not respect the lion. The dog does not know the defensive plans of the blobfish. The jellyfish does not roll the dice for the baboon. The octopus does not remove from the board one of the pieces of the swordfish. And the rules of the game are as follows. Rule1: If you are positive that you saw one of the animals holds an equal number of points as the moose, you can be certain that it will also burn the warehouse that is in possession of the carp. Rule2: Regarding the hare, if it has something to drink, then we can conclude that it proceeds to the spot that is right after the spot of the catfish. Rule3: Regarding the hare, if it has fewer than three friends, then we can conclude that it proceeds to the spot right after the catfish. Rule4: If you are positive that you saw one of the animals prepares armor for the eagle, you can be certain that it will also prepare armor for the buffalo. Rule5: If at least one animal becomes an enemy of the swordfish, then the dog does not prepare armor for the buffalo. Rule6: If at least one animal attacks the green fields of the crocodile, then the baboon rolls the dice for the panda bear. Rule7: If something does not learn elementary resource management from the starfish, then it does not proceed to the spot right after the catfish. Rule8: Be careful when something burns the warehouse of the kudu and also winks at the ferret because in this case it will surely sing a song of victory for the catfish (this may or may not be problematic). Rule9: If at least one animal burns the warehouse that is in possession of the carp, then the catfish owes $$$ to the cheetah. Rule5 is preferred over Rule4. Rule7 is preferred over Rule2. Rule7 is preferred over Rule3. Based on the game state and the rules and preferences, does the catfish owe money to the cheetah?","We know the black bear holds the same number of points as the moose, and according to Rule1 ""if something holds the same number of points as the moose, then it burns the warehouse of the carp"", so we can conclude ""the black bear burns the warehouse of the carp"". We know the black bear burns the warehouse of the carp, and according to Rule9 ""if at least one animal burns the warehouse of the carp, then the catfish owes money to the cheetah"", so we can conclude ""the catfish owes money to the cheetah"". So the statement ""the catfish owes money to the cheetah"" is proved and the answer is ""yes"".",False,False
"A few players are playing a boardgame. The current state of the game is as follows. The cheetah needs support from the eagle. The eel raises a peace flag for the snail. The hippopotamus has one friend that is lazy and six friends that are not. The jellyfish offers a job to the caterpillar. The oscar winks at the crocodile. The pig respects the doctorfish. The starfish learns the basics of resource management from the squid. The whale removes from the board one of the pieces of the squirrel. The zander eats the food of the moose. The zander owes money to the crocodile. The eel does not eat the food of the black bear. And the rules of the game are as follows. Rule1: Regarding the hippopotamus, if it has fewer than 14 friends, then we can conclude that it knows the defense plan of the ferret. Rule2: If you see that something does not sing a victory song for the bat but it raises a peace flag for the snail, what can you certainly conclude? You can conclude that it is not going to roll the dice for the kangaroo. Rule3: If you are positive that one of the animals does not eat the food of the black bear, you can be certain that it will roll the dice for the kangaroo without a doubt. Rule4: If something rolls the dice for the kangaroo, then it does not burn the warehouse that is in possession of the gecko.
