"A few players are playing a boardgame. The current state of the game is as follows. The cat eats the food of the wolverine. The caterpillar becomes an enemy of the hummingbird. The doctorfish respects the crocodile. The eel eats the food of the aardvark, and rolls the dice for the raven. The ferret is named Mojo. The gecko attacks the green fields whose owner is the catfish. The moose shows all her cards to the eagle. The octopus has a piano. The octopus has twenty friends. The penguin eats the food of the ferret. The squirrel attacks the green fields whose owner is the kiwi. The viperfish is named Max. The baboon does not remove from the board one of the pieces of the hare. The parrot does not attack the green fields whose owner is the eagle. The sea bass does not eat the food of the buffalo. The snail does not offer a job to the ferret. And the rules of the game are as follows. Rule1: If you are positive that you saw one of the animals respects the hippopotamus, you can be certain that it will also roll the dice for the cockroach. Rule2: If the octopus has more than 10 friends, then the octopus eats the food of the hummingbird. Rule3: Be careful when something rolls the dice for the raven and also eats the food that belongs to the aardvark because in this case it will surely prepare armor for the whale (this may or may not be problematic). Rule4: For the ferret, if the belief is that the penguin eats the food of the ferret and the snail does not offer a job to the ferret, then you can add ""the ferret does not respect the hippopotamus"" to your conclusions. Rule5: If at least one animal shows all her cards to the eagle, then the phoenix does not offer a job to the moose. Rule6: If the octopus has a device to connect to the internet, then the octopus eats the food of the hummingbird. Rule7: If the ferret has a name whose first letter is the same as the first letter of the viperfish's name, then the ferret respects the hippopotamus. Rule7 is preferred over Rule4. Based on the game state and the rules and preferences, does the ferret roll the dice for the cockroach?","We know the ferret is named Mojo and the viperfish is named Max, both names start with ""M"", and according to Rule7 ""if the ferret has a name whose first letter is the same as the first letter of the viperfish's name, then the ferret respects the hippopotamus"", and Rule7 has a higher preference than the conflicting rules (Rule4), so we can conclude ""the ferret respects the hippopotamus"". We know the ferret respects the hippopotamus, and according to Rule1 ""if something respects the hippopotamus, then it rolls the dice for the cockroach"", so we can conclude ""the ferret rolls the dice for the cockroach"". So the statement ""the ferret rolls the dice for the cockroach"" is proved and the answer is ""yes"".",False,False

The ferret learns the basics of resource management from the swordfish. The koala knows the defensive plans of the ferret. The leopard sings a victory song for the cheetah. The octopus needs support from the gecko. The panther has four friends that are adventurous and 1 friend that is not. The panther is named Teddy.

The kudu does not prepare armor for the viperfish. The starfish does not prepare armor for the hare. The wolverine does not give a magnifier to the cow. And the rules of the game are as follows. Rule1: If the koala knows the defense plan of the ferret, then the ferret sings a victory song for the meerkat. Rule2: For the rabbit, if the belief is that the sheep raises a flag of peace for the rabbit and the ferret holds the same number of points as the rabbit, then you can add that ""the rabbit is not going to attack the green fields of the turtle"" to your conclusions. Rule3: Regarding the panther, if it has fewer than eleven friends, then we can conclude that it eats the food that belongs to the rabbit. Rule4: The spider sings a song of victory for the oscar whenever at least one animal knocks down the fortress of the grasshopper. Rule5: If the panther has a name whose first letter is the same as the first letter of the squirrel's name, then the panther does not eat the food that belongs to the rabbit. Rule6: If you see that something gives a magnifier to the donkey and learns the basics of resource management from the swordfish, what can you certainly conclude? You can conclude that it also holds the same number of points as the rabbit. Rule7: Regarding the sheep, if it killed the mayor, then we can conclude that it raises a peace flag for the rabbit. Rule8: If you are positive that one of the animals does not prepare armor for the salmon, you can be certain that it will not hold the same number of points as the rabbit. Rule5 is preferred over Rule3. Rule8 is preferred over Rule6.

We know the sheep assassinated the mayor, and according to Rule7 ""if the sheep killed the mayor, then the sheep raises a peace flag for the rabbit"", so we can conclude ""the sheep raises a peace flag for the rabbit"".
