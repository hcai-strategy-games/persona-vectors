Question: A few players are playing a boardgame. The current state of the game is as follows. The cat eats the food of the wolverine. The caterpillar becomes an enemy of the hummingbird. The doctorfish respects the crocodile. The eel eats the food of the aardvark, and rolls the dice for the raven. The ferret is named Mojo. The gecko attacks the green fields whose owner is the catfish. The moose shows all her cards to the eagle. The octopus has a piano. The octopus has twenty friends. The penguin eats the food of the ferret. The squirrel attacks the green fields whose owner is the kiwi. The viperfish is named Max. The baboon does not remove from the board one of the pieces of the hare. The parrot does not attack the green fields whose owner is the eagle. The sea bass does not eat the food of the buffalo. The snail does not offer a job to the ferret. And the rules of the game are as follows. Rule1: If you are positive that you saw one of the animals respects the hippopotamus, you can be certain that it will also roll the dice for the cockroach. Rule2: If the octopus has more than 10 friends, then the octopus eats the food of the hummingbird. Rule3: Be careful when something rolls the dice for the raven and also eats the food that belongs to the aardvark because in this case it will surely prepare armor for the whale (this may or may not be problematic). Rule4: For the ferret, if the belief is that the penguin eats the food of the ferret and the snail does not offer a job to the ferret, then you can add "the ferret does not respect the hippopotamus" to your conclusions. Rule5: If at least one animal shows all her cards to the eagle, then the phoenix does not offer a job to the moose. Rule6: If the octopus has a device to connect to the internet, then the octopus eats the food of the hummingbird. Rule7: If the ferret has a name whose first letter is the same as the first letter of the viperfish's name, then the ferret respects the hippopotamus. Rule7 is preferred over Rule4. Based on the game state and the rules and preferences, does the ferret roll the dice for the cockroach?

The hummingbird does not raise a peace flag for the kiwi. The moose does not know the defensive plans of the blobfish. The octopus does not show all her cards to the bat. The turtle does not eat the food of the rabbit. And the rules of the game are as follows.

Rule2: The eel does not knock down the fortress of the lion, in the case where the turtle burns the warehouse that is in possession of the eel. Rule3: The bat will not learn elementary resource management from the cat, in the case where the crocodile does not eat the food that belongs to the bat.

--- Example 35 ---
Question: A few players are playing a boardgame. The current state of the game is as follows. The ferret offers a job to the zander. The halibut rolls the dice for the cockroach. The hippopotamus rolls the dice for the bat. The leopard attacks the green fields whose owner is the panda bear. The mosquito got a well-paid job. The mosquito has a card that is blue in color. The parrot has four friends that are playful and five friends that are not, is named Paco, and knows the defensive plans of the mosquito. The raven is named Pablo. The salmon knows the defensive plans of the octopus. The sheep assassinated the mayor, has a card that is indigo in color, and has three friends that are mean and four friends that are not. The sheep is named Max. The snail is named Luna. The swordfish prepares armor for the aardvark, and steals five points from the cat. The amberjack does not learn the basics of resource management from the sun bear. The donkey does not show all her cards to the spider. The wolverine does not sing a victory song for the dog. And the rules of the game are as follows. Rule1: Regarding the parrot, if it has fewer than 1 friend, then we can conclude that it owes money to the viperfish. Rule2: If the parrot does not owe money to the viperfish but the swordfish respects the viperfish, then the viperfish attacks the green fields of the koala unavoidably. Rule3: Regarding the sheep, if it has more than twelve friends, then we can conclude that it attacks the green fields whose owner is the panda bear. Rule4: If the sheep has a card whose color is one of the rainbow colors, then the sheep attacks the green fields whose owner is the panda bear. Rule5: If the mosquito has a card whose color starts with the letter "l", then the mosquito does not become an actual enemy of the lion. Rule6: If the sheep has a name whose first letter is the same as the first letter of the snail's name, then the sheep does not attack the green fields of the panda bear. Rule7: If something holds an equal number of points as the mosquito, then it does not owe $$$ to the viperfish. Rule8: If the mosquito has a high salary, then the mosquito does not become an enemy of the lion. Rule9: If you are positive that you saw one of the animals knows the defensive plans of the gecko, you can be certain that it will not respect the viperfish. Rule10: Be careful when something prepares armor for the aardvark and also steals five points from the cat because in this case it will surely respect the viperfish (this may or may not be problematic). Rule3 is preferred over Rule6. Rule4 is preferred over Rule6. Rule7 is preferred over Rule1. Rule9 is preferred over Rule10. Based on the game state and the rules and preferences, does the viperfish attack the green fields whose owner is the koala?
